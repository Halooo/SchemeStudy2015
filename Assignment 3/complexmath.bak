;; (posn-mult p1 p2) consumes two Posns and produces a
;;    Posn that is the result of the multiplication
;; posn-mult: Posn Posn -> Posn


;; (posn-div p1 p2) consumes two Posns and produces a
;;    Posn that is the result of dividing p1 by p2
;; posn-mult: Posn Posn -> Posn
;; Restriction: p2 cannot be (make-posn 0 0)
